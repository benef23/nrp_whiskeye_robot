Source data (mostly provided by Martin) are in "src" and "mesh/hi".
See detailed notes inside those folders.

Running "make" in folder "src" updates various files herein; therefore
you should be cautious about modifying files manually - if it makes
more sense, ask Mitch to update the make process.

In "test" there are various sub-folders allowing the state of the
build to be tested.
