To port the existing cognitive architecture driving WhiskEye to the NRP before the Summit to demonstrate progress in mammalbot workpackage.

DONE

- Add plugin.

- Add controllers for each DOF.

- Connect existing cognitive architecture to simulator using ROS interface.

- Add world pose control.

- Put ball in arena with robot, so robot chases ball.

- Route cameras to ROS.

TODO (by Wednesday 3rd October)

- Do sensory side of whisking; generate "xy".
	= We now have contacts in the form (location, normal, depth) in WORLD
	= The next step is to transform these into WHISKER
	= We can then process them to determine x/y deflection
	= That's the output we need
    = We might need to eliminate forces from whisker collisions, to avoid
        weird mechanical effects.

- Get him chasing ball / exploring / something.
    = Remove CqR branding.

- Optionally, Martin may supply individual STLs, in which case I'll add the
import to .dae and the hanging of multiple models off each link, and using
different materials for each, to prettify the robot.

- Pass to Martin as a zip file for him to test on a vanilla install.

- Hand off to Benedict, and he will be tasked with getting this into the NRP,
the main challenge of which will be to invoke and communicate with the
controller.
